This spring I had the opportunity to design a beautiful wedding full of crisp whites and flowing greenery in Louisville, Kentucky. The ceremony was held at the gorgeous and intimate Duncan Memorial Chapel, with the reception following at the 314 Exchange. It was a picture perfect day, full of love & laughter. Diana & Thomas â€“ thank you for letting me be a part of your special day! All photos courtesy of the talented Katelyn V. Photography.
